    <h2>Answer:</h2>
    <p>Although the pigeon is one of the most intelligent of all the bird species, man has found limited uses for the birds other than for the purposes of sport, food and as a message carrier. A team of navy researchers, however, has found
      that pigeons can be trained to save human lives at sea with high success rates.

    <h2>Pigeon Intelligence</h2>
    <p>Pigeons are considered to be one of the most intelligent birds on the planet and able to undertake tasks previously thought to be the sole preserve of humans and primates. The pigeon has also been found to pass the ‘mirror test’ and is one of
      only 6 species, and the only non-mammal, that has this ability. The pigeon can also recognize all 26 letters of the English language as well as being able to conceptualize. In scientific tests pigeons have been found to be able to differentiate
      between photographs and even differentiate between two different human beings in a photograph when rewarded with food for doing so.
